# SQL-Filter


## Objective

Analyze security incident data using SQL queries to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized login attempts and compromised employee accounts.

## Scenario

You're a cybersecurity expert working for a big company. You've noticed some suspicious activity related to login attempts and employee accounts. Your job is to use a special tool called SQL to dig into the company's data and find out what's happening. You'll look at two specific tables: one for employee information and another for login attempts. By using SQL, you can filter the data to identify any unusual patterns or potential security threats.
